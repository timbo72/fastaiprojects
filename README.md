Welcome to my repo of fastai projects

Currently:
1. CatDogChickenBaby
    A simple image classifier including single image classification
2. Image downloader
    Created to obtain small batch (200) data from google images and arrange it for easy importing and class identification.
3. Visualizer
    Following on from CatDogChickenBaby I will generate some layer visualisations and deploy a webap via zeit.co/now
    
Coming soon...
     Cam vid, I really want to have a play with the camvid notebook and see what we can create for porential deployment to a raspberry pi based dashcam.
     A real image classifier, I have been struggling for clever ideas for something to classify, I am fascinated by the 'non-standard' ideas that people have come up with early in this course including audio classification based on waveform images.
